I am a Software Engineer specializing in Backend and Cloud technologies. With a passion for both building systems and building communities, I operate at the intersection of technical execution and developer education.

#### What I do

* **Engineering**
    I build high-performance backend architectures and cloud infrastructure. I thrive on solving difficult technical problems and optimizing systems for scale.

* **Speaking**
    From intimate local meetups to major tech conferences, I share insights on cloud architecture, backend development, and software best practices. I believe in open knowledge sharing to help the community stay ahead of the curve.

* **Education**
    I author technical course material that trains the next generation of developers, breaking down complex backend concepts into actionable, industry-ready learning paths.

Off the clock, when I'm not deploying code or on stage, I am a dedicated reader and a lifelong student of the industry, constantly exploring new tech trends to share with the community.
