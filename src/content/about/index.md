I am a Software Engineer specializing in Backend and Cloud technologies. With a passion for both building systems and building communities, I operate at the intersection of technical execution and developer education.

#### What I do

* **Engineering**:
    I develop efficient, scalable software and AI solutions with a specific focus on Back-End architecture and Cloud infrastructure. My goal is to write robust, maintainable code that solves complex problems while ensuring high availability and performance.

* **Speaking**:
    From intimate local meetups to major tech conferences, I share insights on cloud architecture, backend development, and software best practices. I believe in open knowledge sharing to help the community stay ahead of the curve.

* **Education**:
    I serve as a curriculum writer for **Indonesia's largest edutech company** with 1.3M+ Monthly visits that trains the next generation of developers, breaking down complex backend concepts into actionable, industry-ready learning paths.

Off the clock, when I'm not deploying code or on stage, I am a dedicated reader and a lifelong student of the industry, constantly exploring new tech trends to share with the community.
