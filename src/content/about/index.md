I'm a passionate software engineer who builds bridges between complex problems and elegant solutions. By day, I'm wrangling code and writing course material that helps students learn coding, especially Back-End. By night, you'll find me on Twitter/X or exploring the latest tech trends.

I'm long life learner, i love to learn about software engineering, and self development. Also, i love to read book with various topic.
